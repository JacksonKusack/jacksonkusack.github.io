    <section id="about">
      <h3>About Me</h3>
      	<p>I am a quantitative ecologist/ornithologist pursuing my PhD at Western University. For my PhD research, I am investigating migration patterns of ducks in the Great Lakes region using stable isotopes. In general, my research interests fall within the category of conservation. My previous research has examine breeding success of Barn Swallows in a mixed agro-ecosystem looking at how agricultural intense crops influenced the body condition and diet of nestlings (Masters of Science in Biology, Western University - Thesis https://ir.lib.uwo.ca/etd/5900/ ).</p>
	    	<p>I've been birding for the better part of a decade and have recently branched out into other taxonomic groups including Diptera, Lepidoptera and Odonata. Most of my time has been spent in southern Ontario, where most of my ecology knowledge is focussed. But I grew up in the Greater Vancouver Area and attended Thompson Rivers University in Kamloops BC for my undergraduate education, so I have some familiarity with the Pacific northwest. </p>

            <h4>Hoverfly Migration</h4>
            <p>Hoverflies are important pollinators across all ecosystems in North America. They also provide pest control as the larval stage of some species predate aphids, thrips, and other pest insects. Despite their importance, very little is known about the movements of hoverflies in North America, outside of anecdotal information. In Europe, several hoverfly species are known migrants, exhibiting mass movements at alpine passes and over waterbodies. Our main objective is to use stable-hydrogen isotopes (<i>δ</i><sup>2</sup>H) to investigate migratory vs. locally emergent origin for six species of hoverflies (<i>Eristalis dimidiata, Eristalis tenax, Eristalis arbustorum, Eristalis transversa, Eupeodes americanus, Helophilus fasciatus</i>; Syrphidae) in southern Ontario. We chose species that showed evidence of seasonal range expansion potentially indicative of migratory movements. We expect some local and some migratory individuals with an increased number of migrants during the theoretic migratory window (May and August-October) compared to the summer.</p> 
	          <p>A second component of this was to exploratore if the spatial distribution of hoverflies (or other migratory insects) varies over time. Specifically if the distributions varry over spring and fall migration, which could indicate migratory movements. While many migratory insects do not exhibit clean round-trip migratory behaviour, examining these periods is a good start. We did those using citizen science observations within the iNaturalist platform.</p>

            <h4>Connectivity of Waterfowl Populations</h4>
            <p>Conservation and management of migratory birds requires detailed information on connectivity between breeding, wintering, and stopover sites. For harvested waterfowl, it is especially important to deliver adaptive harvest management strategies which rely on evidence-based science.Harvest derivations (i.e., proportion of harvested birds that each breeding region contributed to the total harvest in each harvest area) are used to derive measures of connectivity. These derivations typically rely on leg-band returns, but banding is logistically and financially difficult. Further, current banding 
effort does not adequately sample the entire breeding range for many northern breeding waterfowl which may introduce bias into harvest derivations based on leg-band returns.  </p>
		  	    <p>For my PhD research I am using stable-hydrogen isotopes to derive these derivations and explore biases in those based entirely on band-returns. Specifically, I am (1) validating the relationship between precipitation <i>δ</i><sup>2</sup>H  values and feather <i>δ</i><sup>2</sup>H values for waterfowl in North America (<b>Kusack et al. 2023b</b>); (2) compare derivations based on leg-band returns and stable isotopes; (3) investigate the “flyover hypothesis” for harvested American Black Duck across their range, 
comparing the relationship between age, sex, and region on likely natal/moult origin (<b>Kusack et al. 2023b</b>). </p>
